Deploying this chatbot to a social media site, or platform is pretty straightforward. First, we should save our model in something akin to a hadoop file.
Next, we create a web application using any number of things like Flask, or Django for a server to handle our responses. For something like Discord we can
run a Flask app and make API calls to the Discord API with a key and such to have our bot actually output on discord. After this we would parse user input, sending
that directly to our webapp that would run it through the model and evaluate what to do. I'm not entirely sure the process of creating an application like this on
a platform like Twitter, but I'm guessing similar API calls are available to Twitter bots.
